Servo’s mission is to provide an independent, modular, embeddable web engine,
which allows developers to deliver content and applications using web
standards.

Servo is written in the new systems programming language
[Rust](https://rust-lang.org), and shares code with Mozilla Firefox and the
wider Rust ecosystem. Since its creation in 2012, Servo has contributed to
W3C/WHATWG web standards by reporting specification issues and submitting new
cross-browser automated tests, and core team members have co-edited new
standards that have been adopted by other browsers. As a result, the Servo
project helps drive the entire web platform forward while building on a
platform of reusable, modular technologies that implement web standards.
