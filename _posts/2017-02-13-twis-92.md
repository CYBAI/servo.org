In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2017-02-06..2017-02-13+user%3Aservo+),
we landed 118 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

Both the [Quantum CSS](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/acolCIYh0RI) and
[Quantum Render](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/_D8PbwHaomw) projects took important steps last
week by merging the relevant project branches into the main Firefox source tree. This means that it's now possible to run
these experimental powered-by-Servo-technology builds by flipping a build-time switch in a local development build, and
automated tests are tracking any new regressions that these builds cause.

### Planning and Status

Our overall [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) is available online, including the overall plans for 2017 and Q1. Please check it out and provide feedback!
