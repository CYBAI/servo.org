In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-09-05..2016-09-12+user%3Aservo), we landed 78 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

We are excited to [announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.servo/xzUbuMdaz5o) that Josh Matthews, a member of the Mozilla Firefox DOM team, is now a part of the [Servo core team](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Governance)! He has long played a key role in the project, and we look forward to his future work.

### Planning and Status

Our overall [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) is available online and now includes the initial Q3 plans. From now on, we plan to include the quarterly plan with a high-level breakdown in the roadmap page.
