In the [last three weeks](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-08-15..2016-09-05+user%3Aservo), we landed 278 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

One of the biggest changes from the last few weeks is the [heroic work]https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/11756) by Vlad Vukicevic to migrate us from a mingw build on Windows over to Microsoft Visual C++. Thanks for this amazing work, bringing us much closer to a native Windows development experience!

Last week, Shing Lyu hosted 6 new Servo contributors as part of the Taiwan Code Sprint. In conjunction with jdm and KiChjang, these new contributors landed 14 patches in just two days!

I (larsberg) would like to apologize for the hiatus in This Week in Servo during my vacation. I'll try to hand it off in the future!

### Planning and Status

Our overall [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) is available online and now includes the initial Q3 plans. From now on, we plan to include the quarterly plan with a high-level breakdown in the roadmap page.
