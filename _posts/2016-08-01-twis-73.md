In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-07-25..2016-08-01+user%3Aservo), we landed 85 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

Guillaume Gomez (imperio) wins the award for Most Tenacious Developer for this week! He heroically pushed along his changes to [add](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/12186) a video metadata parser and has been working tirelessly on licensing and library distribution/reference issues around it. Thanks, imperio!
