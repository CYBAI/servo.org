In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-06-27..2016-07-04+user%3Aservo), we landed 122 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

The big news, of course, is that we [released](https://blog.servo.org/2016/06/30/servo-nightlies/) initial Servo Nightly builds for macOS and Linux! We'd like to give a big thank-you to everybody who helped in the days leading up to the release, testing, providing last-minute fixes, and responding so quickly to questions in IRC and social media after the launch. We're really happy with how the launch went and are looking forward to releasing Windows and Android builds soon!

### Planning and Status

Our overall [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) is available online. We will be doing our Q3 planning in the upcoming week.
