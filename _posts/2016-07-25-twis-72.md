In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-07-18..2016-07-25+user%3Aservo), we landed 79 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

The team working on WebBluetooth in Servo has launched a new [site](http://szeged.github.io/servo/)! It has [two demo videos](http://szeged.github.io/servo/demos/) and very detailed instructions and examples on how to use standards-based Web Platform APIs to connect to Bluetooth devices.

We'd like to especially thank UK992 this week for their AMAZING work helping us out with Windows support! We are really eager to get the Windows development experience from Servo up to par with that of other platforms, and UK992's work has been amazing.

Connor Brewster (cbrewster) has also been on an incredible tear, working with Alan Jeffry, on figuring out how session history is supposed to work, clarifying the standard and landing some great fixes into Servo.

### Planning and Status

Our overall [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) is available online and now includes the initial Q3 plans. From now on, we plan to include the quarterly plan with a high-level breakdown in the roadmap page.
