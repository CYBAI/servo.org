In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-06-20..2016-06-27+user%3Aservo), we landed 84PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

One of our contributors, Florian Duraffourg, [landed](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/11513) a patch recently that switched our public domain list matching source and algorithm, resulting in a huge speedup in page load times (~25%!). Shing Lyu tracked down and measured this unexpectedly-large gain through a new automated page load testing performance infrastructure that he has been testing. It [compares](https://treeherder.allizom.org/perf.html#/graphs?timerange=2592000&series=%5Bservo,fa13b4451149bf7a5cc1361e22154f5165ec3734,1,8%5D&series=%5Bservo,1e657115c9bc80a8400875ebc0e0c97402899f67,1,8%5D&series=%5Bservo,0f0b217962ea5748c137d0c5927bd85c28ec2661,1,8%5D&series=%5Bservo,8bf74f1cf43a3628d242086847b2048444d1a55a,1,8%5D&series=%5Bservo,9241bc5d3b8170dcaa8efaa06c972fbae9334772,1,8%5D) Servo daily builds against Firefox for page load on a subset of the Alexa Top 1000 sites. Check it out!

We're excited to announce that Connor Brewster (cbrewster on IRC and github) is the [newest addition](https://github.com/servo/saltfs/pull/403) to the list of Servo reviewers!

This upcoming week is the final week of June! So, expect the first tech preview of Servo and browser.html to be announced on this blog shortly...
