In the [last two weeks](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-07-04..2016-07-18+user%3Aservo), we landed 173 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

We have gotten great feedback and many new contributors from the [release](https://blog.servo.org/2016/06/30/servo-nightlies/) of initial Servo Nightly builds. Hopefully we can continue that as we [launch](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/12125) Windows builds this week!

In addition to the [list of CSS properties](http://doc.servo.org/servo/css-properties.html) that Servo supports, we now also automatically generate a [list of DOM APIs](http://doc.servo.org/servo/apis.html) that are implemented.

### Planning and Status

Our overall [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) is available online and now includes the initial Q3 plans. From now on, we plan to include the quarterly plan with a high-level breakdown in the roadmap page.

This week's status updates are [here](http://statusupdates.dev.mozaws.net/project/servo).
