This summer, [Servo][servo] is participating in both [Google Summer of Code][gsoc] and 
[Rails Girls Summer of Code][rgsoc].

If you have a passion for open source and want to work on a 3-month mentored Rust project in Servo
(with a stipend), consider applying!

The Rails Girls Summer of Code project ideas can be found [here][rgsoc-servo], and the Google Summer
of Code ideas are [here][gsoc-servo]. Applications need not be confined to these ideas; if you have
something else you want to work on let us know.


Applications for Rails Girls Summer of Code are accepted from late February to March 15th. See
[here][rgsoc-eligible] for eligibility. The coding period is from July to September.

Applications for Google Summer of Code are from 14-25th March. See [here][gsoc-eligible] for
eligibility. The coding period is from 23 May to 23 August.

Feel free to ask question on the #servo IRC channel on [irc.mozilla.org][irc], or email us at
josh@joshmatthews.net or manishearth@gmail.com.


_If you're interested in Rust there are [some][rgsoc-nom] [other][gsoc-ubuntu] Rust projects out
there too._
