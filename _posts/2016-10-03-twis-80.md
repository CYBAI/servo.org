In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-09-26..2016-10-03+user%3Aservo), we landed 103 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

One of the largest challenges for new contributors in the DOM area is understanding how all of the pieces fit together. A new blog post by jeenalee [provides](http://jeenalee.com/2016/10/03/implementing-doge-for-servo.html) a very clear and compelling walkthrough of how to to contribute support for a new DOM API into Servo!

In a big step forward, glennw [made](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/13382) WebRender not only on by default but also made it possible to be used in our testing infrastructure! WebRender can now be used with OSMesa as its backend. See [this](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.servo/nUM_vaU0BK8) mailing list thread if you have opinions on the future of the deprecated and untested Azure/Moz2D code path.

Finally, we had two students contribute to Servo as part of the [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) program, and we wrote up the [results](https://blog.servo.org/2016/09/28/gsoc-summary/) of their efforts. Spoilers: they did great and Servo is better for it!

### Planning and Status

Our overall [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) is available online and now includes the Q3 plans. The Q4 and 2017 planning will begin shortly!

This week's status updates are [here](http://statusupdates.dev.mozaws.net/project/servo).
