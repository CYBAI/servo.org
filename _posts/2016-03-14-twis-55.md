In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-03-07..2016-03-14+user%3Aservo), we landed 78 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

We are pleased to announced that [Aneesh Agrawal](https://github.com/aneeshusa) has become a reviewer! He is a major contributor to the [Saltstack](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/) project, and has been providing contributions and feedback on our CI infrastructure for a long time now. Thanks for all your help, Aneesh!

Servo is planning to make its first alpha releases available in June. These will use the [browser.html](https://github.com/browserhtml/browser.html) user interface by default. We will begin making nightly builds available for Linux, OSX, Windows, and Android (though Android will likely have a more minimal browser chrome, if any).

### Meetings

In last week's meeting, we [discussed](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2016-03-07) the Windows CI, a HUGE perf improvement to [reviewable.io](http://reviewable.io) on Firefox, maintenance of various dependencies, the Browser.html workweek, intermittent failures, and the state of Promises in JS.
