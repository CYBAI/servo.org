In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-02-15..2016-02-22+user%3Aservo), we landed 72 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

The biggest news from last week is that WebRender [landed]() in Servo master! It is behind a flag right now (`-w`) and still has some bugs, but the move to shift more of Servo
into the GPU in the pursuit of 60 fps CSS animations continues! This was great work over many months by glennw and pcwalton. The first talk at the most recent Rust
meetup [covered](https://air.mozilla.org/bay-area-rust-meetup-february-2016/) this, and there are additional details on the [WebRender wiki](https://github.com/glennw/webrender/wiki).

Paul Rouget also made it possible to install Servo on OSX via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)! Just do `brew install --HEAD servo/servo/servo` and wait 30 minutes for it to compile!
Nightly builds coming soon...

### Screenshot

Attila Dusnoki ([dati](https://github.com/dati91) on IRC) from the University of Szeged has [made great progress](http://imgur.com/6tFDItd) in getting Servo on embedded ARM Linux to connect up over Bluetooth (via Rust to dbus) with
a Google Chromebook. IoT, here we come!

### Meetings

The meeting was canceled last week, due to US and Canadian Holidays.
