In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-08-01..2016-08-08+user%3Aservo), we landed 89 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

The unstoppable vvuk has been on a tear this week, landing a huge number of changes across our dependencies to enable support for compiling Servo with the Microsoft Visual C++ toolchain (instead of GNU GCC toolchain on Windows via mingw, which is what we do today). That looks like it will land soon, and it's been amazing work pulling it together. The Windows development experience is going to be much better after that lands, and we're really excited to bring the Windows dev experience up to the same quality as the MacOS and Linux ones.

### Planning and Status

Our overall [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) is available online and now includes the initial Q3 plans. From now on, we plan to include the quarterly plan with a high-level breakdown in the roadmap page.
