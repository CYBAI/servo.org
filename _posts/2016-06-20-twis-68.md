In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-06-13..2016-06-20+user%3Aservo), we landed 55 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

The entire Servo team and several of our contributors spent last week in London for the Mozilla All Hands meeting. While this meeting resulted in fewer PRs than normal, there were many great meetings that resulted in both figuring out some hard problems and introducing more people to Servo's systems. These meetings included:

 - [Security work planning](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/London-Security)
 - [Detailed Rust/Servo-in-Gecko planning](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/London-Oxidation)
 - [In-depth overview of Servo's style and layout systems](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Layout-Overview)
 - [Overview of WebRender and lessons learned in WR1 applied to WR2](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Webrender-Overview)

### Planning and Status

Our overall [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) and [quarterly goals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JMOtVkRtb-s7auoQdnX810HGglkMK054LTXOo0_rdrU/pub) are available online.
