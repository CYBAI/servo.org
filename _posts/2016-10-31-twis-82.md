In the [last two weeks](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-10-17..2016-10-31+user%3Aservo), we landed 246 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

The really big news is the [announcement](https://medium.com/mozilla-tech/a-quantum-leap-for-the-web-a3b7174b3c12#.vj4tu2kpu) of Project Quantum. This project will advance the web engine in Firefox, and some of the core pieces of this effort come from Servo! Please read our [mailing list post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.servo/3bH1KaqJq0s) for more information. Or check out the articles from [CNet](https://www.cnet.com/news/firefox-quantum-mozilla-faster-web-gecko-engine/), [Tom's Hardware](http://www.tomshardware.com/news/firefox-quantum-leap-performance-security,32938.html), and others!

Mortimer Goro [finished adding](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/13840) WebGL support on Windows! He and his team [wrote](https://blog.mozvr.com/webvr-coming-to-servo-part-1/) up a fantastic blog post detailing the architecture, some implementation details, and the overall status.

In the last week, fitzgen has gone on a tear, opening and mentoring a ton of new `E-Easy` bugs in [rust-bindgen](https://github.com/servo/rust-bindgen/). This is a great example of the kind of work that really helps to grow the community!

### Planning and Status

Our overall [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) is available online and now includes the Q4 plans and tentative outline of some ideas for 2017. Please check it out and provide feedback!
