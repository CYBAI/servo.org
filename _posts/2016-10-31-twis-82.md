In the [last two weeks](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-10-17..2016-10-31+user%3Aservo), we landed 246 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

The really big news is the [announcement](https://medium.com/mozilla-tech/a-quantum-leap-for-the-web-a3b7174b3c12#.vj4tu2kpu) of Project Quantum. This project will advance the web engine in Firefox, and some of the core pieces of this effort come from Servo! Please read our [mailing list post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.servo/3bH1KaqJq0s) for more information. Or check out the articles from [CNet](https://www.cnet.com/news/firefox-quantum-mozilla-faster-web-gecko-engine/), [Tom's Hardware](http://www.tomshardware.com/news/firefox-quantum-leap-performance-security,32938.html), and others!

Mortimer Goro [finished adding](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/13840) WebGL support on Windows! He and his team [wrote up](https://blog.mozvr.com/webvr-coming-to-servo-part-1/) a fantastic blog post detailing the architecture, some implementation details, and the overall status.

In the last week, fitzgen has gone on a tear, opening and mentoring a ton of new `E-Easy` bugs in [rust-bindgen](https://github.com/servo/rust-bindgen/). This is a great example of the kind of work that really helps to grow the community!

Shing Lyu [gained](https://github.com/servo/saltfs/pull/512) reviewer privileges! He's been contributing both to new layout and style features, as well as creating an automated performance harness to catch regressions, and now can put his experience to good use in reviewing changes to those areas.

### Planning and Status

Our overall [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) is available online and now includes the Q4 plans and tentative outline of some ideas for 2017. Please check it out and provide feedback!

This week's status updates are [here](http://statusupdates.dev.mozaws.net/project/servo).
