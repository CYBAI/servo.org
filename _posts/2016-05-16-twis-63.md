In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-05-06..2016-05-16+user%3Aservo), we landed 156 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

Emily Dunham has been working on an org-wide [report](http://servo.github.io/servo-org-stats/) of the contributor metrics. It's looking good already, but there is still a lot of fun python work to do on the [scripts](https://github.com/servo/servo-org-stats), for those who want to make sure we're not counting things incorrectly!

### Planning and Status

Our overall [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) and [quarterly goals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JMOtVkRtb-s7auoQdnX810HGglkMK054LTXOo0_rdrU/pub) are available online.

This week's status updates are [here](http://statusupdates.dev.mozaws.net/project/servo).
