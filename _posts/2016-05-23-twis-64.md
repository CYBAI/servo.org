In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-05-16..2016-05-23+user%3Aservo), we landed 99 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

This is a week of many additions to the Servo team - a Research Assistant and two full-time hires!

Kyle Headley is joining us from U. Colorado at Boulder, where he is working with Matthew Hammer on incremental computation. He's going to be working as a Research Assistant this summer, helping us find ways we can use incremental computation to improve the performance of Servo. He's kheadley on IRC.

Manish Goregaokar is a long-time Servo contributor, initially participating in the first round of Google Summer of Code with Servo. He has mostly worked on DOM-related issues and Rust itself, but is looking forward to working on new things. He is currently working remotely from Mumbai, but will be relocating to the San Francisco office later this year. He is manishearth on IRC.

Diane Hosfelt previously did network and protocol analysis for the Department of Defense, and will start out working on Servo's networking (an area sorely in need of some expert work!). Diane is working remotely from the UK. She is dd0x68 on IRC.

Welcome to the team, everybody!
