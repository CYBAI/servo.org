In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-06-06..2016-06-13+user%3Aservo), we landed 85 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

That number is a bit low this week, due to some issues with our CI machines (especially the OSX boxes) that have hurt our landing speed. Most of the staff are in London this week for the Mozilla All Hands meeting, but we'll try to look at it.

### Planning and Status

Our overall [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) and [quarterly goals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JMOtVkRtb-s7auoQdnX810HGglkMK054LTXOo0_rdrU/pub) are available online.
