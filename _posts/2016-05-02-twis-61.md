In the [last two weeks](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-04-18..2016-05-02+user%3Aservo), we landed 228 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

### Planning and Status

Our overall [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) and [quarterly goals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JMOtVkRtb-s7auoQdnX810HGglkMK054LTXOo0_rdrU/pub) are available online.

This week's status updates are [here](http://statusupdates.dev.mozaws.net/project/servo).

[Zhen Zhang](https://github.com/izgzhen/) and [Rahul Sharma](https://github.com/creativcoder/) were selected as 2016 GSoC students for Servo! They will be working on the [File API](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.servo/-TxazKAXL7M/ptZHxDI7BQAJ) and foundations for [Service Workers](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.servo/-cjHbb-PUKs/FB_BsEY2BQAJ) respectively.
