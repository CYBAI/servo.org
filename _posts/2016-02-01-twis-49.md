In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-01-25..2016-02-01+user%3Aservo), we landed 87 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

[Mátyás Mustoha](https://github.com/mmatyas) has been doing awesome work bringing fixes and stability to our cross-compilation to both AArch64 and ARM 32-bit. He has a nightly build that runs [here](https://travis-ci.org/mmatyas/servo-nightly), which we hope to integrate into our own CI systems. Thanks for your great work improving the experience targeting those platforms!
