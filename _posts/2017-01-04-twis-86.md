summary:    What's up with Servo for the weeks of 19 Dec 2016 - 2 Jan 2017

In the [last two weeks](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-12-19..2017-01-02+user%3Aservo+),
we landed 164 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories. This number is lower than usual due many contributors rightfully
taking time to enjoy the holidays.

Due to hard work by UK992 and the team at the University of Szeged our continuous integration systems are now
[gating](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.servo/1P5-iuECa88) on Windows MSVC and Android builds. This will make it much harder to regress support for these platforms
as we go forward.

All changes to Servo's style system implementation now [require documentation](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.servo/upEvlBx7w1g).
Thank you to bz for filing the [issue](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/14765) prompting this change!

Please welcome [antrik](https://github.com/antrik/) as an [official reviewer](https://github.com/servo/saltfs/pull/568) for
[ipc-channel](https://github.com/servo/ipc-channel/). They have been performing this role unofficially for some time,
as well as being a prolific contributor to the library, and it's good to finally recognize antrik's efforts here.

### Planning and Status

Our overall [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) is available online. Plans for 2017 (including Q1) will be
solidified in the coming week. Please check it out and provide feedback!
