In the [last two weeks](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-11-14..2016-11-28+user%3Aservo), we landed 200 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories. This number is slightly lower than our recent average due to some pretty bad intermittent test failure problems on our build machines and the long US holiday break. We're working on solutions to the intermittent problem right now.

The rust-url integration into Firefox just [landed](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1151899)! Manish and Valentin Gosu have been working on this for a long time, and with some work from Ted and Nathan, it's now available behind a flag. It will probably be some time before it reaches full compatibility with all of the specialized and internal things that Firefox does with URLs and can be used by default, but this is a huge first step and the largest integration of Rust code into Firefox to date.

### Planning and Status

Our overall [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) is available online and now includes the Q4 plans and tentative outline of some ideas for 2017. Please check it out and provide feedback!

This week's status updates are [here](http://statusupdates.dev.mozaws.net/project/servo). This service is shutting down immediately, and we will have to move to a new status update mechanism next week.
