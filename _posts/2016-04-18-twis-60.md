In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-04-11..2016-04-18+user%3Aservo), we landed 120 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

We have [cancelled](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.servo/WwG0Rmh84Bg) the weekly meeting. In order to ensure we still make the same or more information available, This Week in Servo will be extended to include planning/status information, call out any other ad-hoc meetings that occur during the week, and mention any notable threads on the mailing list.

### Planning and Status

Our overall [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) and [quarterly goals](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/Servo-Q2-2016) are available online.

This week's status updates are [here](http://statusupdates.dev.mozaws.net/project/servo).
