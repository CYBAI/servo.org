In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2017-01-30..2017-02-06+user%3Aservo+),
we landed 119 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

Congratulations to our [newest](https://github.com/servo/saltfs/pull/594) reviewer, Xidorn Quan! They have been mentoring
lots of issues related to Stylo and providing unofficial reviews on many changes to the style system, so it's nice to
make this official!

Servo has been [vendored](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1322769) into Firefox's source tree to allow more efficient coordination between the two projects. Servo's github repository continues to be the project's official home, so nothing changes for contributors focusing on improving Servo.

### Planning and Status

Our overall [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) is available online. The plans for 2017 (including Q1) have
now been documented. Please check it out and provide feedback!
