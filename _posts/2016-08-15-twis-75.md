In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-08-08..2016-08-15+user%3Aservo), we landed 108 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

Thanks to the community for their patience while our continuous integration services were were in a more manual mode as we adapted to some changes from Travis CI that complicated our autolander. Things should be fine now - please reach out in #servo if you see anything!

We are delighted to announce that long-time contributor Michael Howell (notriddle) has been [made](https://github.com/servo/saltfs/pull/425) a reviewer! Thanks for all of your contributions and congratulations on your new role.
