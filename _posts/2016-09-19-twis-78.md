In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-09-05..2016-09-12+user%3Aservo), we landed 68 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

### Planning and Status

Our overall [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) is available online and now includes the initial Q3 plans. From now on, we plan to include the quarterly plan with a high-level breakdown in the roadmap page.

This week's status updates are [here](http://statusupdates.dev.mozaws.net/project/servo).

Special thanks to [canaltinova](https://github.com/canaltinova) for their work on
[implementing the matrix transition algorithms for CSS3 transform animation](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/13188).
This allows (both 2D and 3D) `rotate()`, `perspective()` and `matrix()` functions to be
interpolated, as well as interpolations between arbitrary transformations, though the last bit is
yet to be implemented. In the process of implementation, we had to deal with
[many spec bugs](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/483),
as well as [implementation bugs](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1303037)
in other browsers, which complicated things immensely -- it's very hard to tell if your code
has a mistake or if the spec itself is wrong in complicated algorithms like these. Great work, canaltinova!

### Screenshot

Some screencasts of [matrix interpolation](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/13188) at work:

This one shows all the basic transformations together
(running a tweaked version of [this page](https://mozdevs.github.io/servo-experiments/experiments/test-transformations/).
The 3d rotate, perspective, and matrix transformation were enabled by the recent change.
