In the [last three weeks](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-11-28..2016-12-19+user%3Aservo), we landed 236 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories. This number is lower than usual due to a week-long Mozilla All-Hands gathering that many team members attended.

jdm [presented](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.servo/qIwmGZqfuiY) a plan for the DOM-related work in Servo for 2017. Please provide feedback if you feel anything important is missing from it!

Congratulations to [kvark](https://github.com/servo/saltfs/pull/551) on their new [reviewer privileges](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Reviewer). They have been contributing important features to WebRender and reviewing changes by other contributors, so it's great to make this official.

### Planning and Status

Our overall [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) is available online, including the Q4 plans and tentative outline of some ideas for 2017. Please check it out and provide feedback!
