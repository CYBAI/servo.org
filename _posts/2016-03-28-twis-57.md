In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2016-03-21..2016-03-28+user%3Aservo), we landed 108 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

We are pleased to announce that Bobby Holley ([bholley](https://github.com/bholley)), a long-time Gecko hacker, has become a reviewer! He will primarily be reviewing patches in the style system, especially those related to Gecko integration.
